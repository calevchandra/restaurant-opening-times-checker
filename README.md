# Coding Test - Open Restaurants

## Specification

Your task is to read a JSON file that contains data describing the opening
times of a number of restaurants, and then provide a method for querying
which of the restaurants are open at a specified date and time.

A simple code and test skeleton written in JavaScript/Mocha is provided to help
get you started, but you may write your solution in any language.

## Test Data

Test data can be found in the `restaurant_data.json` file. Inspect this file
to determine the kind of input data that your code should be able to handle.

All the data in `restaurant_data.json` are correct and valid. You may add
additional entries for testing purposes, but please do not alter the existing
content.

## Additional Information

- All dates and times can be assumed to be in the same time zone
- The input file can be assumed to be well-formed and contain no invalid data
- Remember to write tests for your solution, particularly for any edge cases
  that could occur in the input data

## Deliverable

The deliverable is the source code and files required to build and run your
solution. Either a public git repository, e.g. GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket, or
a zip archive.

Please also provide a README that contains the following:

- Any instructions needed to boot and test your solution
- A technical overview of the implementation, including:
  - A summary of its architecture.
  - Technical justification of key design decisions with comparison to other
    possible approaches.
  - Implementation notes that would help orient a coder new to the code
  - Any areas of the design or implementation that could be improved further or
    that you would like specific feedback on.

## Tips

- A simple and straightforward design is preferred. Avoid unnecessary
  complexity.
- Using a strict code linter and automatic formatter is recommended
- Remove debug or other unnecessary code before submitting
- Don't forget the tests.

## Questions
